# CAPTCHA-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
This repository contains code for training and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for CAPTCHA recognition using the Captcha Version 2 Images dataset from Kaggle.

This repository contains the code for training and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize captchas using the [Captcha Version 2 Images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images/data) from Kaggle.

### Dataset
- **[Captcha Version 2 Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images/data)**
  - This dataset comprises captcha images used for training and testing the model.

### Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files used for training the model, evaluating performance, and testing the model on the dataset.
- `models/`: This directory will contain saved models after training.
- `data/`: The directory where dataset files and images are stored.

### How to Use
1. **Download the Dataset:** Obtain the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images/data).
2. **Execution:** Utilize Jupyter Notebook files for training, evaluation, and testing of the model.
3. **Contribute:** Open a Pull Request if you'd like to contribute improvements.

This project aims to recognize captchas using a Convolutional Neural Network model and is created for educational and research purposes.
